;STORMBRINGER's BATCH FILE VIRUS, a quick and dirty disassembly
;for Crypt Newsletter 24, by UKouch.
;
;Almost a year ago, Popular Science magazine published a "semi-technical"
;story on computer viruses.  As a demonstrator, the
;magazine included a "virus" constructed from batch commands.  As supplied,
;it did not work.
;
;However, although batch files are not normally thought of as targets or
;platforms for computer viruses, they can become so.  Ralf Burger's
;"Computer Viruses and Data Protection" (1991, Abacus) published 
;an example of how a batch file could be used to spread and 
;create viruses.  Crypt Newsletter 12 also
;published an example of how a batch file could be used as a dropper
;for new or any previously discovered IBM computer virus; a later
;issue developed the PC Carbuncle which constructed custom batch
;files used to execute itself - stored elsewhere as a hidden file -
;and targeted programs which were swapped to different names under
;indirect control by the virus.
;
;Stormbringer - the programmer who won Mark Ludwig's First International
;Virus Writing Contest - has written a computer virus which specifically
;parasitizes the "executable code" or batch command structure of any
;batch file.  While simple to understand conceptually, the programming
;which constitutes BATCH VIRUS is tricky and quite interesting.
;For example, infecting a batch file lets a virus simply add itself
;to the end of file without the absolute necessity of creating a jump
;to its own code at the beginning of the file and the concomitant
;rearrangement of host code which is involved. It also simplifies
;certain portions of the virus because it no longer has to figure out
;on the fly how its code displacements change from host file to host
;file of different size. It only knows that the batch file will eventually
;execute it, just like any string of typed commands, if present.
;
;The source code included here is not the BATCH VIRUS itself, but its
;dropper; the BATCH VIRUS only exists appended to infected batchfiles,
;one sample which is included as VIRUS.BAT.
;
;What the BATCH VIRUS does is search the current directory for
;uninfected batch files, recognizing itself through the old 4096 virus
;technique of queering the time/date stamp on the file to a nonsense
;value 100 years ahead of the file's original stamp. This is rather
;unique when practiced on batch files.  As with viruses which use this
;stunt to infect compiled code, the changed date does not appear to
;the user, but it is present in DOS's information on the file in
;question and BATCH VIRUS can and does recognize it.
;
;When it finds an uninfected batch file, BATCH VIRUS opens it, sets the 
;file pointer to the end of the target - usually two line feeds beyond
;the last typed command in the batch file - and writes itself to the
;file as an elaborate DEBUG script. The batch file and script turn off 
;output to the screen and input from the keyboard, reads data into the MS-DOS
;program DEBUG, executing the code in the process, thus infecting more
;batch files before returning control to the user. Obviously, the virus
;must assume that the MS/PC-DOS program DEBUG is present on the computer
;and accessible via the machine path - an environment which is a given
;if the user has DOS on the machine in an average configuration.
;Of course, if DEBUG has been taken off the machine, the virus
;won't work.
;
;To replicate, the virus reads its image into the batch file as data
;which is "echo'd" via batch command to a temporary file called batvir.94.  
;DOS creates this file for the virus, and much of the virus's data handling
;goes into reading text batch commands and DEBUG data of its image into the
;host - just as one might type it from the keyboard - complete with
;the necessary linefeeds, spaces and carriage returns.  
;In the critical set of virus commands, the batch process creates 
;the temporary file (batvir.94) which is used as a data pump for the
;program DEBUG which shells from the batch file, loads the BATCH VIRUS and 
;executes it as a program with the "g" or GO command. The virus takes control
;of the machine during this step and searches for more batchfiles
;to infect, exiting if none are found. The virus, or more accurately,
;its supporting batch commands in the original host, issues a "q" to
;QUIT debug, then deletes the temporary file created
;at start and returns control to the user.
;
;BATCH VIRUS works, although the rapid opening and closing of infected
;batch files by DOS makes it noticeable.  Normally, anti-virus programs
;do not consider batch files as viable targets for virus infection,
;so they're relatively blind to this type of attack. This is not,
;necessarily, a point of concern since actual batch viruses are rare,
;and the whole process is not particularly effective as a means of 
;propagating replicating code from machine to machine.
;Still, it can be done, and BATCH VIRUS demonstrates the point.
;
;VIRUS.BAT is a "host" batch file infected by BATCH VIRUS and it will
;infect other batch files if executed in a directory with them.
;
;The assembly language dropper can be constructed using the A86 assembler.
;It is not precisely identical to Stormbringer's original BATCH VIRUS,
;but it is close enough to study the code, make the dropper and convey 
;the general mechanics of the program.
