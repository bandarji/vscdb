; Catch-22, a TSR loader by Rhincewind [Vlad]
;
; This is probably the most experimental thing I've done so far. In this 
; loader I've combined a few things I learned about tbmem into a pretty 
; neat loader that the current version of tbmem will not detect.
;
; The highloader is pretty straightforward, although it does use one
; trick I found. It traces the PSP chain all the way back to the command
; interpreter, then makes that PSP active before a block is allocated for
; the loader. This so-called 'context switching' will make the newly
; allocated block property of your command interpreter, ensuring it's
; lasting residency. Down with direct MCB twiddling!
;
; Now tbmem comes into play. First, two facts:
;
; Fact 1 - Tbmem detects residency on vectorchanges only. It can't be
;          bothered to look at the memory itself.
; Fact 2 - Tbmem does not flag on intel reserved registers being hooked.
;
; For starters the loader will hook int3, thereby not alerting tbmem as
; above. The first byte of the int28 handler, which is an IRET in the
; original handler, will be overwritten
; with an int3. Now, as you probably know, only the command
; interpreter calls int28 (Okay, so do Terminate and a handful of other
; programs, watch out for those) which is redirected to our routine.
; We managed to get a routine active around tbmem! Hurray! Now, the int3
; handler will countdown 75 times, 13 is the minimum btw, to make sure
; that we're back in command mode, that is, out of the dos deallocation
; routines before we hook int21, which again, will elude tbmem. Both int28 
; and int3 are restored and we're done with our loader.
