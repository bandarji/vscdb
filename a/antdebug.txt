  Today's anti debugging tricks devide into two categories:

  1. Preventive actions;
  2. Self-modifying code.

  Most debugging tricks, as for today, are used within viruses, in order to
avoid dis-assembly of the virus, as it will be exampled later in this file.
Another big part of anti debugging tricks is found with software protection
programs, what use them in order to make the cracking of the protection
harder.

1. Preventive actions:
----------------------

  Preventive actions are, basically, actions that the program takes in order
to make the user unable to dis-assemble the code or trace it while running.

1.1. Interrupt disable:

       Interrupt disable is probably the most common form of anti-debugging
     trick. It can be done in several ways:

   1.1.1. Hardware masking of interrupt:

            In order to avoid tracing of a code, one usually disables the
          interrupt via the 8259 Interrupt Controller, addressed by read/write
          actions to port 21h. The 8259 Interrupt Controller controls the IRQ
          lines. This means that any IRQ between 0 and 7 may be disabled by
          this action. Bit 0 is IRQ0, bit 1 is IRQ1 etc. Since IRQ1 is the
          keyboard interrupt, you may disable the keyboard without the
          debugger being able to bypass it.

          Example:

          CS:0100 E421           IN     AL,21
          CS:0102 0C02           OR     AL,02
          CS:0104 E621           OUT    21,AL

            Just as a side notice, the keyboard may be also disabled by
          commanding the Programmable Perepheral Interface (PPI), port 61h.

          Example:

          CS:0100 E461           IN     AL,61
          CS:0102 0C80           OR     AL,80
          CS:0104 E661           OUT    61,AL

   1.1.2. Software masking of interrupt:

            This is quite an easy form of anti-debugging trick. All you have
          to do is simply replace the vectors of interrupts debuggers use/any
          other interrupt you will not be using or expecting to happen. Do not
          forget to restore the original vectors when you are finished.
          It is adviseable to use manual change of vector, as shown below,
          rather than to change it using interrupt 21h service 25h, because
          any debugger that has gained control of interrupt 21h may replace
          your vector with the debugger's. The example shows an interception
          of interrupt 03h - the breakpoint interrupt.

          Example:

          CS:0100 EB04           JMP    0106
          CS:0102 0000           ADD    [BX+SI],AL
          CS:0104 0000           ADD    [BX+SI],AL
          CS:0106 31C0           XOR    AX,AX
          CS:0108 8EC0           MOV    ES,AX
          CS:010A 268B1E0C00     MOV    BX,ES:[000C]
          CS:010F 891E0201       MOV    [0102],BX
          CS:0113 268B1E0E00     MOV    BX,ES:[000E]
          CS:0118 891E0401       MOV    [0104],BX
          CS:011C 26C7064C000000 MOV    Word Ptr ES:[000C],0000
          CS:0123 26C7064E000000 MOV    Word Ptr ES:[000E],0000

   1.1.3. Vector manipulation

            This method involves manipulations of the interrupt vectors,
          mainly for proper activation of the algorithm. Such action, as
          exampled, may be used to decrypt a code (see also 2.1), using data
          stored ON the vectors. Ofcourse, during normal operation of the
          program, vectors 01h and 03h are not used, so unless you are trying
          to debug such a program, it works fine.

          Example:

          CS:0100 31C0           XOR    AX,AX
          CS:0102 8ED0           MOV    SS,AX
          CS:0104 BC0600         MOV    SP,0006
          CS:0107 8B0E0211       MOV    CX,[1102]
          CS:010B 50             PUSH   AX
          CS:010C 21C8           AND    AX,CX
          CS:010E 01C5           ADD    BP,AX
          CS:0110 58             POP    AX
          CS:0111 E2F8           LOOP   010B

   1.1.4. Interrupt replacement

            This is a really nasty trick, and it should be used ONLY if you
          are ABSOLUTELY sure that your programs needs no more debugging. What
          it does is simply copy the vectors of some interrupts you will be
          using, say 16h and 21h, onto the vectors of interrupt 01h and 03h,
          that do not occure during normal operation of the program. If the
          user wants to debug the program, he would have to search for every
          occurance of INT 01, and replace it with the appropriate INT
          instruction.

          Example:

          CS:0100 FA             CLI
          CS:0101 31C0           XOR    AX,AX
          CS:0103 8EC0           MOV    ES,AX
          CS:0105 26A18400       MOV    AX,ES:[0084]
          CS:0109 26A30400       MOV    ES:[0004],AX
          CS:010D 26A18600       MOV    AX,ES:[0086]
          CS:0111 26A30600       MOV    ES:[0006],AX
          CS:0115 B44C           MOV    AH,4C
          CS:0117 CD01           INT    01

1.2. Time watch:

       This may be a less common method, but it is usefull against debuggers
     that disable all interrupts except for the time that the program is
     executed, such as Borland's Turbo Debugger. This method simply retains
     the value of the clock counter, updated by interrupt 08h, and waits in an
     infinite loop until the value changes. Another example is when you mask
     the timer interrupt by ORing the value INed from port 21h with 01h and
     then OUTing it back, thus disabling the IRQ0 - Timer interrupt. Note that
     this method is usefull only against RUN actions, not TRACE/PROCEED ones.

     Example:

     CS:0100 2BC0           SUB    AX,AX
     CS:0102 FB             STI
     CS:0103 8ED8           MOV    DS,AX
     CS:0105 8A266C04       MOV    AH,[046C]
     CS:0109 A06C04         MOV    AL,[046C]
     CS:010C 3AC4           CMP    AL,AH
     CS:010E 74F9           JZ     0109

1.3. Fool the debugger:

       This is a very nice technique, that works especially and only on those
     who use Turbo Debugger or its kind. What you do is init a jump to a
     middle of an instruction, whereas the real address actually contains
     another opcode. If you work with a normal step debugger such as Debug or
     SymDeb, it won't work since the debugger jumps to the exact address of
     the jump, and not to the beginning of an instruction at the closest
     address, like Turbo Debugger.

     Example:

     CS:0100 E421           IN     AL,21
     CS:0102 B0FF           MOV    AL,FF
     CS:0104 EB02           JMP    0108
     CS:0106 C606E62100     MOV    Byte Ptr [21E6],00
     CS:010B CD20           INT    20

     Watch this:

     CS:0108 E621           OUT    21,AL

1.4. Cause debugger to stop execution:

       This is a technique that causes a debugger to stop the execution of a
     certain program. What you need to do is to put some INT 3 instructions
     over the code, at random places, and any debugger trying to run will stop
     there. Since this techniqu causes the CPU to stop executing the program,
     and therefore clear the Prefetch Instruction Queue, it is adviseable to
     use this techinque in conjunction with the PIQ trick, 2.2.2. Note that
     the example shows how to use these two tricks together.

     Example:

     CS:0100 B97502         MOV    CX,0275
     CS:0103 BE9001         MOV    SI,0190
     CS:0106 89F7           MOV    DI,SI
     CS:0108 AC             LODSB
     CS:0109 C70610013473   MOV    Word Ptr [0110],7334
     CS:010F CC             INT    3
     CS:0110 2406           AND    AL,06
     CS:0112 AA             STOSB
     CS:0113 C70610012406   MOV    Word Ptr [0110],0624
     CS:0119 E2ED           LOOP   0108

1.5. Halt TD386 V8086 mode:

       This is a nice way to fool Turbo Debugger's V8086 module (TD386). It is
     baed on the fact that TD386 does not use INT 00h to detect division by
     zero (or register overrun after division, which is treated by the
     processor in the same way as in case of division by zero). When TD386
     detects a division fault it aborts, reporting about the faulty
     division. In real mode (even under a regular debugger), a faulty DIV
     instruction will cause INT 00h to be called. Therefore, pointing INT 00h
     to the next instruction, will recover from the faulty DIV.

     Note: It is very important to restore INT 00h's vector. Otherwise, the
     next call to INT 00h will cause the machine to hang.

     Example:

     CS:0100 31C0          XOR     AX,AX
     CS:0102 8ED8          MOV     DS,AX
     CS:0104 C70600001201  MOV     WORD PTR [0000],0112
     CS:010A 8C0E0200      MOV     [0002],CS
     CS:010E B400          MOV     AH,00
     CS:0110 F6F4          DIV     AH
     CS:0112 B8004C        MOV     AX,4C00
     CS:0115 CD21          INT     21

1.6. Halt any V8086 process:

       Another way of messing TD386 is fooling it into an exception.
     Unfortunately, this exception will also be generated under any other
     program, running at V8086 mode. The exception is exception #13, and its
     issued interrupt is INT 0Dh - 13d. The idea is very similar to the
     divide by zero trick: Causing an exception, when the exception interrupt
     points to somewhere in the program's code. It will always work when the
     machine is running in real mode, but never under the V8086 mode.

     Note: It is very important to restore the original interrupt vectors.
     Otherwise, the next exception will hang the machine.

     Example:

     CS:0100 31C0          XOR     AX,AX
     CS:0102 8ED8          MOV     DS,AX
     CS:0104 C70634001301  MOV     WORD PTR [0034],0113
     CS:010A 8C0E3600      MOV     [0036],CS
     CS:010E 833EFFFF00    CMP     WORD PTR [FFFF],+00
     CS:0113 B8004C        MOV     AX,4C00
     CS:0116 CD21          INT     21

2. Self-modifying code:
-----------------------

2.1. Encryptive/decryptive algorithm:

       The first category is simply a code, that has been encrypted, and has
     been added with a decryption routine. The trick here is that when a
     debugger sets up a breakpoint, it simply places the opcode CCh (INT 03h)
     in the desired address, and once that interrupt is executed, the debugger
     regains control of things. If you try to set a breakpoint AFTER the
     decryption algorithm, what is usually needed, you will end up putting an
     opcode CCh in a place where decryption action is taken, therefore losing
     your original CCh in favour of whatever the decryption algorithm makes.
     The following example was extracted from the Haifa virus. If you try to
     set a breakpoint at address CS:0110, you will never reach that address,
     since there is no way to know what will result from the change. Note that
     if you want to make the tracing even harder, you should start the
     decryption of the code from its END, so it takes the whole operation
     until the opcode following the decryption routine is decrypted.

     Example:

     CS:0100 BB7109         MOV    BX,0971
     CS:0103 BE1001         MOV    DI,0110
     CS:0106 91             XCHG   AX,CX
     CS:0107 91             XCHG   AX,CX
     CS:0108 2E803597       XOR    Byte Ptr CS:[DI],97
     CS:010C 47             INC    DI
     CS:010D 4B             DEC    BX
     CS:010E 75F6           JNZ    0106
     CS:0110 07             POP    ES
     CS:0111 07             POP    ES

2.2. Self-modifying code:

   2.2.1. Simple self-modification:

            This method implements the same principle as the encryption
          method: Change the opcode before using it. In the following example,
          we change the insruction following the call, and therefore, if you
          try to trace the entire call ('P'/Debug or F8/Turbo Debugger), you
          will not succeed, since the debugger will put its CCh on offset 104h,
          but when the routine runs, it overwrites location 104h.

          Example:

          CS:0100 E80400         CALL   0107
          CS:0103 CD20           INT    20
          CS:0105 CD21           INT    21
          CS:0107 C7060301B44C   MOV    Word Ptr [0103],4CB4
          CS:010D C3             RET

          Watch this:

          CS:0103 B44C           MOV    AH,4C

   2.2.2. Prefetch Instruction Queue (PIQ) manipulation:

            This method is a bit similar to (1.3), but it fools ANY debugger,
          or any other process that executes one operation at a time. The PIQ
          is an area within the CPU, that pre-fethces, ie. takes in advance,
          instructions from memory, so when they need to be executed, it
          would take less time to get them, since they are already in the CPU.
          The PIQ length ranges from 6 or 4 in old computers, up to as high as
          25 in new ones. What the trick does is change the FOLLOWING opcode
          to something meaningless. If you are debugging, then the change will
          take place BEFORE the instructions is executed or fetched. If you
          run the program NORMALLY, by the time you change the opcode, it will
          have already been fetched.

          Example:

          CS:0100 B97502         MOV    CX,0275
          CS:0103 BE9001         MOV    SI,0190
          CS:0106 89F7           MOV    DI,SI
          CS:0108 AC             LODSB
          CS:0109 C7060F012406   MOV    Word Ptr [010F],0624
          CS:010F 3473           XOR    AL,73
          CS:0111 AA             STOSB
          CS:0112 C7060F012406   MOV    Word Ptr [010F],0624
          CS:0118 E2EE           LOOP   0108

          Watch this:

          CS:010F 2406           AND    AL,06
